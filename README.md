This repository contains Matlab codes for the paper **"Practical Guidelines for Data-driven Identification of Lifted Linear Predictors for Control"**.

Each m-file located in this directory represents an example that can be directly run.

**Note:** To run examples with wheeled robot, OSQP solver is required. 
In the directory ./theHood/MPC_functions/, run **install_osqp.m**. This should install the OSQP solver for QP for your system. Refer to https://osqp.org/ for further information.
